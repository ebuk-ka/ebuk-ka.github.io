             <h2>What is Coding?</h2>
             <p>Coding is the process of creating instructions for computers using programming languages.Now these languages learnt, are used mostly by web developers to talk to the computer using a language e.g java,javascript,python e.t.c</p>
                <p>These instructions tell the computer what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. Coding is used to create software applications, websites, games, and much more.</p>
                <p>In simple terms, coding is the language that computers understand. Just like humans communicate with each other using languages like English or Spanish, computers communicate using programming languages.</p>
                <p>By learning to code, you can create your own programs and applications, automate tasks, and solve complex problems. Coding is a valuable skill that is in high demand in today's job market.</p>
