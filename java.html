        <h1>Welcome to Java Basics</h1>
        <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is widely used for building applications across various platforms.</p>

        <h2>Key Features of Java</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Java code can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it platform-independent.</li>
            <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java follows the object-oriented programming paradigm, allowing for modular and reusable code.</li>
            <li><strong>Strongly Typed:</strong> Java enforces strict type checking, reducing runtime errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Rich Standard Library:</strong> Java provides a vast collection of libraries and frameworks for various tasks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started with Java</h2>
        <p>To start coding in Java, you need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer. You can download the latest version from the official Oracle website. Once installed, you can write Java code in any text editor or use an integrated development environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.</p>
        <h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
        <p>Java syntax is similar to other C-based languages. Here are some basic concepts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Classes and Objects:</strong> Java is an object-oriented language, and everything is organized into classes and objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Functions in Java are called methods, and they are defined within classes.</li>
            <li><strong>Control Structures:</strong> Use <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>while</code> statements for conditional logic and loops.</li>
            <li><strong>Packages:</strong> Java uses packages to organize classes and avoid naming conflicts.</li>
        </ul>
